<h3>The free web space at GCI was never really free and now it's also not available.</h3>

As of Tuesday, October 18, 2016 GCI no longer offers a static web space along with internet service.
I have updated a number of things related to this copy of what was on the static web space
 as well as this and a couple other pages but leaving the below RANT.

<br><br>
<b>If $40.00 x 3 = $120.00 minimum is free.</b>  Then this page is on a 10MB
free web space.

I decided I must include the above RANT and several others in this page
about what I have discovered about the "Free web space"	associated
with my current Cable Modem Internet service.  From some casual surfing
on the web I believe my situation is far from unique.

<ul>
<li>Customer Support for my ISP can provision a new web space on their
 server or reset the ftp password if I have enough personal information
 related to <b>the billing account</b> assosiated with this free service.

<li>Customer Support for my ISP does not know about the configuration
 of the webspace and can only identify it as personal web space.
 When getting this space the person I was on the phone with could
 not tell me if directory browsing was supported.  He could not tell
 me what document names would be processed if present before a
 directory index was presented if such a thing were to happen.

<li>Customer Support for my ISP was willing to wait until my
 web space was provisioned (he warned me that it could take
 several minutes) and until I was able to logon with ftp.  He was
 able to repeat the password for the newly provisioned web
 space while I was accessing it with ftp.

</ul>And on the more posative note ...
<ul>

<li>A <a href="z090105-default.htm">default.htm</a> document
 is created during provisioning.

<li>Renaming the default.htm document enables directory browsing.
<li>An index.html or index.htm document also replaces the
browsing within a directory. 
<li>A <a href="HEADER.html">HEADER.html</a> document within
a directory will replace the default directory listing header.
<li>A <a href="README.html">README.html</a> document within
a directory will replace the default directory listing footer.
<li>The <a href="HEADER.html">HEADER.html</a> and
<a href="README.html">README.html</a> documents do not appear
as documents in the directory listing but the contents are
included in the appropriate parts of the directory listing
and can be directly referenced even though hidden.

<li>A set of files and folders were created to support Front Page
extensions.
<li>Files or folders beginning with the "." dot character are
not listed in a directory listing and thus are hidden even
with directory browsing enabled and without a defined index
document existing.  Folders beginning with
the "_" underline character, such as those created to support
Front Page extensions are visible.
<li>Although a .htaccess file existed to support Front Page
extensions, I was unable to add any Apache directives to it
that did not result in a 500 server error.  I did not expect
a quick resolution that resulted in help other than undo.
</ul>

All of the notes on the posative above were created by
testing against default Apache configuration behavior and
the above comments describe Apache default configuration
for many installations.
<br><br>
All of the more negative results reported above are based
on extensive amounts of time waiting for a customer service
person on a toll free line and a very short bit of time
actually speaking to a customer support person.
